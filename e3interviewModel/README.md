This project focuses on the interview to patient E3. 

The patient is an 86 year old female who was diagnosed as having an incipient senility 4 or 5 years ago, when she started noticing she sometimes forgot words and phone numbers.

She lives alone but her two sisters and niece live closeby. Although she is capable of doing almost every day to day chore she is taken care by her small sister and niece who do almost everything for her.

The problems they report she has are the following:

* Sometimes when speaking she forgets words. She is aware of that.
* Routinely forgets dates and times for schedules such as doctors.
* Forgets about tasks she has already done like having breakfast.
* She forgets about ever having been in places like the hospital where she usually goes.
* Has difficulties when she has to take decisions. For example at one time her house flooded and  she didn't knew what to do about it.
* Has had mood changes. It is reported that before she was more grumpy but now she seems more calmed and relaxed.
* She has lower energy drive. Nowadays she is more lazy while before she was always doing things.

She is mostly aware of her illness and age and has more or less accepted she is close to death. This results in a better character and humour and giving less importance to small things.

For this use-case three symptoms have been modelled: 
* Forgetfulness when speaking with a low probability (0.075) of forgeting what she was going to say.
* Lower energy drive was modelled by applying a delay (200) filter to actions such as getting out of bed or standing up from a chair.
* Difficulties when taking decisions have been modeled by applying a low probability (0.075) of replacing any task with one in which she says: "I'm not sure what to do"
