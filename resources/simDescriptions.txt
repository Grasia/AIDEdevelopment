SimNoSymptoms
This is the base simulation of a typical day of the patient. No symptoms attached.
SimMovement
In this simulation the patient has the reported movement problems. His actions are 400% slower and has a 25% chance of being unable to perform them.
SimDisorient
In this simulation the patient faces disorientation problems. He has a 50% chance of losing his thoughts while walking and wandering his home instead.
2
SimNoSymptoms
This simulation is modeled after the typical day the patient reports in the interview. No symptoms attached.
SimMemoryLoss
In this simulation the patient has a low probability (0.05) of forgetting where he was going and wandering the house instead.
3
SimSpeech
This simulation models a conversation in which the patient with senility has a chance of forgetting a word. The act of forgetting is modeled with a filter that makes her unable to speak with a probability of 0.075.
SimMovement
This simulation models a set of movements that the patient has difficulty performing . For this we created a filter in which the acts of walking, sitting and getting in and out of bed are delayed by a percentage of 150.
SimTasks
This simulation models the situation in which the patient sometimes forgets what is she doing. For this we created a filter in which the task she is about to perform is replaced by another one in which she talks aloud.
4
SimNoSymptoms
Base simulation with no symptom filters attached. Just the 24-hour schedule described in the interview.
SimMemory
This simulation models memory problems reported at the interview. The patient has a 0.33 probability of forgetting where she was going with the effect of wandering the house instead.
5
SimNoSymptoms
This is a base simulation with no symptoms attached to the patient. It covers a 24-hour cycle as described in the interview.
SimDisorient
In this simulation the patient sometimes (probability of 0.3) forgets where she was going, says it out loud and then goes to where his daughter is located to request some help.
SimMobility
This simulation models the reported mobility problems. The patient walks 300% slower than normal.
SimFall
For this simulation a falling filter was created. The patient has a 0.2 chance of falling while walking by herself.
SimAll
This simulation combines the three symptom filters into one. Patient walks more slowly, sometimes forgets where she was going and sometimes falls to the ground while walking.
6
SimNoSymptoms
Simulation with no symptoms attached, just the normal daily tasks are performed with no impairment.
SimMovement
Simulates low movement  problems. The patient performs tasks such as walking, sitting and getting in and out of bed 120% slower.
SimDisorient
Simulates disorientation with a low probability (0.05). In this case, the filter for disorientation only makes the act of walking 500% slower.
SimTremors
Simulates tremors. The patient has trembling hands and tasks executed with them are a 150% slower than normal.
SimAll
Simulation in which all symptoms get combined. The patient has movement difficulties, sometimes gets disoriented while walking and has hand tremors.
7
SimNoSymptoms
This is the base simulation which models a typical day as reported in the interview. No symptoms are attached.
SimTremors
For this simulation a tremor filter was created. Because of this the patient has a 0.2 probability of executing tasks such as drinking, eating or switching lights 130% slower.
SimDisorient
In this simulation the patient has a 0.5 chance of getting disoriented while walking. Because of this these tasks are performed 300% slower.
SimAll
This simulation combines both symptoms. The patient has hand tremors and gets disoriented when walking.
8
SimDisorient
In this simulation the patient wakes up at 4am totally disoriented and goes out into the street just to realise that it's not morning time so she returns to bed. She then proceeds with her normal activities.
9
SimNoSymptoms
This simulation models the entire patient's day without any symptom attached
SimTremors
In this simulation the patient has hand tremors. Because of this she has a 30percent chance of performing tasks more slowly.
SimErraticWalking
This simulation focuses on the reported fact of erratic walking. The patient has a 30percent chance of forgetting where she was going and cycles to her bedroom and to the door.
SimAllSymptoms
In this simulation both symptoms are combined. Tremors make the patient perform tasks more slowly and she sometimes loses track of where she was going and wanders a bit through the house.
10
SimNoSymptoms
This simulation models the patients daily activities when she was still living at home with her housekeeper
SimRepeatTalk
This simulation models one of the patients symptoms which is reported as echoing herself a lot, talking about the same thing over and over again.
